The language modeling task is to assign a probability for the likelihood of a given word (or a sequence of words) to follow a sequence of words. A sequence of tokens are passed to the embedding layer first, followed by a positional encoding layer to account for the order of the word (see the next paragraph for more details). The nn.TransformerEncoder consists of multiple layers of nn.TransformerEncoderLayer. Along with the input sequence, a square attention mask is required because the self-attention layers in nn.TransformerEncoder are only allowed to attend the earlier positions in the sequence. For the language modeling task, any tokens on the future positions should be masked. To produce a probability distribution over output words, the output of the nn.TransformerEncoder model is passed through a linear layer followed by a log-softmax function."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vose8wGWSH7b"},"source":["Define the model\n","----------------\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9Rs-gzEqSH7d"},"source":["import math\n","from typing import Tuple\n","\n","import torch\n","from torch import nn, Tensor\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","from torch.nn import TransformerEncoder, TransformerEncoderLayer\n","from torch.utils.data import dataset\n","\n","\n","class TransformerModel(nn.Module):\n","\n","    def __init__(self, ntoken: int, d_model: int, nhead: int, d_hid: int,\n","                 nlayers: int, dropout: float = 0.5):\n","        super().__init__()\n","        self.model_type = 'Transformer'\n","        self.pos_encoder = PositionalEncoding(d_model, dropout)\n","        encoder_layers = TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model, nhead, d_hid, dropout)\n","        self.transformer_encoder = TransformerEncoder(encoder_layers, nlayers)\n","        self.encoder = nn.Embedding(ntoken, d_model)\n","        self.d_model = d_model\n","        self.decoder = nn.Linear(d_model, ntoken)\n","\n","        self.init_weights()\n","\n","    def init_weights(self) -> None:\n","        initrange = 0.1\n","        self.encoder.weight.data.uniform_(-initrange, initrange)\n","        self.decoder.bias.data.zero_()\n","        self.decoder.weight.data.uniform_(-initrange, initrange)\n","\n","    def forward(self, src: Tensor, src_mask: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Args:\n","            src: Tensor, shape [seq_len, batch_size]\n","            src_mask: Tensor, shape [seq_len, seq_len]\n","\n","        Returns:\n","            output Tensor of shape [seq_len, batch_size, ntoken]\n","        \"\"\"\n","        src = self.encoder(src) * math.sqrt(self.d_model)\n","        src = self.pos_encoder(src)\n","        output = self.transformer_encoder(src, src_mask)\n","        output = self.decoder(output)\n","        return output\n","\n","\n","def generate_square_subsequent_mask(sz: int) -> Tensor:\n","    \"\"\"Generates an upper-triangular matrix of -inf, with zeros on diag.\"\"\"\n","    return torch.triu(torch.ones(sz, sz) * float('-inf'), diagonal=1)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"csKuT5S3TSSM"},"source":["PositionalEncoding module injects some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence.
