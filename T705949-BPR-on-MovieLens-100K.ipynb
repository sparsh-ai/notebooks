The best possible value that the AUC evaluation metric can take is 1, and any non-random ranking that makes sense would have an AUC > 0.5. An intuitive explanation of AUC is it specifies the probability that when we draw two examples at random, their predicted pairwise ranking is correct. The following documentation has a more detailed discussion on AUC in case you're not familiar with it."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9Orl71G1kzig","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633087326342,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2914,"user":{"displayName":"Sparsh Agarwal","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"13037694610922482904"}},"outputId":"60adbc62-cbda-4dd9-dc1e-947910e87330"},"source":["def auc_score(model, ratings):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    computes area under the ROC curve (AUC).\n","    The full name should probably be mean\n","    auc score as it is computing the auc\n","    for every user's prediction and actual\n","    interaction and taking the average for\n","    all users\n","    \n","    Parameters\n","    ----------\n","    model : BPR instance\n","        Trained BPR model\n","        \n","    ratings : scipy sparse csr_matrix, shape [n_users, n_items]\n","        sparse matrix of user-item interactions\n","    \n","    Returns\n","    -------\n","    auc : float 0.0 ~ 1.0\n","    \"\"\"\n","    auc = 0.0\n","    n_users, n_items = ratings.shape\n","    for user, row in enumerate(ratings):\n","        y_pred = model._predict_user(user)\n","        y_true = np.zeros(n_items)\n","        y_true[row.indices] = 1\n","        auc += roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred)\n","\n","    auc /= n_users\n","    return auc\n","\n","print(auc_score(bpr, X_train))\n","print(auc_score(bpr, X_test))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0.8971582016228873\n","0.8278732737462875\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MYMYeQEIkmaN"},"source":["### Item Recommendations\n","Given the trained model, we can get the most similar items by using the get_similar_items method, we can specify the number of most similar items by specifying the N argument.
