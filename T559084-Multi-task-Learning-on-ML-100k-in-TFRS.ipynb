For example, an e-commerce site may record user visits to product pages (abundant, but relatively low signal), image clicks, adding to cart, and, finally, purchases. It may even record post-purchase signals such as reviews and returns.\n","\n","Integrating all these different forms of feedback is critical to building systems that users love to use, and that do not optimize for any one metric at the expense of overall performance.\n","\n","In addition, building a joint model for multiple tasks may produce better results than building a number of task-specific models. This is especially true where some data is abundant (for example, clicks), and some data is sparse (purchases, returns, manual reviews). In those scenarios, a joint model may be able to use representations learned from the abundant task to improve its predictions on the sparse task via a phenomenon known as [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning). For example, [this paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJxPVcSonN) shows that a model predicting explicit user ratings from sparse user surveys can be substantially improved by adding an auxiliary task that uses abundant click log data.\n","\n","In this tutorial, we are going to build a multi-objective recommender for Movielens, using both implicit (movie watches) and explicit signals (ratings)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZwrcZeK7x7xI"},"source":["## Imports\n","\n","\n","Let's first get our imports out of the way.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"izzoRqkGb2Zc"},"source":["!pip install -q tensorflow-recommenders\n","!pip install -q --upgrade tensorflow-datasets"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SZGYDaF-m5wZ"},"source":["import os\n","import pprint\n","import tempfile\n","\n","from typing import Dict, Text\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import tensorflow_datasets as tfds"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"BxQ_hy7xPH3N"},"source":["import tensorflow_recommenders as tfrs"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5PAqjR4a1RR4"},"source":["## Preparing the dataset\n","\n","We're going to use the Movielens 100K dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-ySWtibjm_6a"},"source":["ratings = tfds.load('movielens/100k-ratings', split=\"train\")\n","movies = tfds.load('movielens/100k-movies', split=\"train\")\n","\n","# Select the basic features.\n","ratings = ratings.map(lambda x: {\n","    \"movie_title\": x[\"movie_title\"],\n","    \"user_id\": x[\"user_id\"],\n","    \"user_rating\": x[\"user_rating\"],\n","})\n","movies = movies.map(lambda x: x[\"movie_title\"])"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JRHorm8W1yf3"},"source":["And repeat our preparations for building vocabularies and splitting the data into a train and a test set:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rS0eDfkjnjJL"},"source":["# Randomly shuffle data and split between train and test.\n","tf.random.set_seed(42)\n","shuffled = ratings.shuffle(100_000, seed=42, reshuffle_each_iteration=False)\n","\n","train = shuffled.take(80_000)\n","test = shuffled.skip(80_000).take(20_000)\n","\n","movie_titles = movies.batch(1_000)\n","user_ids = ratings.batch(1_000_000).map(lambda x: x[\"user_id\"])\n","\n","unique_movie_titles = np.unique(np.concatenate(list(movie_titles)))\n","unique_user_ids = np.unique(np.concatenate(list(user_ids)))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eCi-seR86qqa"},"source":["## A multi-task model\n","\n","There are two critical parts to multi-task recommenders:\n","\n","1.
