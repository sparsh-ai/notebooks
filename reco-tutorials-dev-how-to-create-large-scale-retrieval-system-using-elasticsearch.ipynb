Indexing: documents are first converted to vectors using deep learning models (aka embedding models). They are then indexed and stored on disk by Elasticsearch.\n","2. Retrieving: a user query is first converted to its vector representation.

This gives us accurate results but it is slow and memory-intensive. This will not work for industrial-scale retrieval demand where we have to retrieve thousands of matching vectors per user, for millions of users in a near-realtime settings. To overcome this challenge, researchers found a technique called **Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN)**. In this technique, instead of exhaustively searching the full vector space, we only retrieve top-k nearest neighbour vectors. The accuracy slightly gets reduced but the gain in retrieval speed is worth the tradeoff.
