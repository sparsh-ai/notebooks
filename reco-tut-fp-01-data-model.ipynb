It formalizes the interfaces of the building blocks of the language itself, such as sequences, functions, iterators, coroutines, classes, context managers, and so on.\n","\n","When using a framework, we spend a lot of time coding methods that are called by the framework. The same happens when we leverage the Python Data Model to build new classes. The Python interpreter invokes special methods to perform basic object operations, often triggered by special syntax. The special method names are always written with leading and trailing double underscores. For example, the syntax `obj[key]` is supported by the `__getitem__` special method."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"USTBJenC8c-x"},"source":["> **MAGIC AND DUNDER**\\\n","> The term magic method is slang for special method, but how do we talk about a specific method like __getitem__?

It’s short, but it packs a punch.\n","1. First, like any standard Python collection, a deck responds to the `len()` function by returning the number of cards in it.\n","2. Reading specific cards from the deck—say, the first or the last—is easy, thanks to the `__getitem__` method.\n","3. How to pick a random card? Should we create a method inside `FrenchDeck` card class? No need. Python already has a function to get a random item from a sequence: `random.choice`. We can use it on a deck instance. It’s easier to benefit from the rich Python standard library and avoid reinventing the wheel, like the `random.choice` function.\n","4. But it gets better. Because our `__getitem__` delegates to the [] operator of `self._cards`, our deck automatically supports slicing. Here’s how we look at the top three cards from a brand-new deck, and then pick just the Aces by starting at index 12 and skipping 13 cards at a time.\n","5. Just by implementing the `__getitem__` special method, our deck is also iterable.\n","6. Iteration is often implicit. If a collection has no `__contains__` method, the `in` operator does a sequential scan. Case in point: `in` works with our FrenchDeck class because it is iterable.\n","7. How to sort the cards by the given ranking notion. We can sort by passing the method of ranking notion.\n","8. How about shuffling? As implemented so far, a `FrenchDec`k cannot be shuffled, because it is immutable: the cards, and their positions cannot be changed, except by violating encapsulation and handling the `_cards` attribute directly."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"y-qheXPk7kvZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1627759736609,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":521,"user":{"displayName":"Sparsh Agarwal","photoUrl":"","userId":"13037694610922482904"}},"outputId":"d805bf8f-5871-4577-b937-097eddf93caf"},"source":["# we use len(deck) instead of deck.__len__()\n","deck = FrenchDeck()\n","print(\"\\n{}\\n\".format(\"=\"*50))\n","print(len(deck))\n","\n","# we use deck(idx) instead of deck.__getitem__(idx)\n","print(\"\\n{}\\n\".format(\"=\"*50))\n","print(deck[0])\n","print(deck[-1])\n","\n","# picking some random cards\n","from random import choice\n","print(\"\\n{}\\n\".format(\"=\"*50))\n","print(choice(deck))\n","print(choice(deck))\n","print(choice(deck))\n","\n","# picking cards with slicing\n","print(\"\\n{}\\n\".format(\"=\"*50))\n","print(deck[:3])\n","print(deck[12::13])\n","\n","# iterating\n","print(\"\\n{}\\n\".format(\"=\"*50))\n","for card in deck[:5]:\n","    print(card)\n","\n","# checking if a card is in deck\n","print(\"\\n{}\\n\".format(\"=\"*50))\n","print(Card('Q', 'hearts') in deck)\n","print(Card('7', 'beasts') in deck)"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n","==================================================\n","\n","52\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Card(rank='2', suit='spades')\n","Card(rank='A', suit='hearts')\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Card(rank='Q', suit='diamonds')\n","Card(rank='7', suit='clubs')\n","Card(rank='9', suit='diamonds')\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","[Card(rank='2', suit='spades'), Card(rank='3', suit='spades'), Card(rank='4', suit='spades')]\n","[Card(rank='A', suit='spades'), Card(rank='A', suit='diamonds'), Card(rank='A', suit='clubs'), Card(rank='A', suit='hearts')]\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Card(rank='2', suit='spades')\n","Card(rank='3', suit='spades')\n","Card(rank='4', suit='spades')\n","Card(rank='5', suit='spades')\n","Card(rank='6', suit='spades')\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","True\n","False\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RgEveUC-91Iy"},"source":["A common system of ranking cards is by rank (with aces being highest), then by suit in the order of spades (highest), hearts, diamonds, and clubs (lowest).
