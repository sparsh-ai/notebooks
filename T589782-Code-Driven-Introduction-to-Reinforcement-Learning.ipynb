Desptite simple and restrictive – the sign of a good interface – a suprising number of situations can be squeezed into the MDP formalism.\n","\n","### The MDP Entities\n","An MDP has two “entities”:\n","1. An agent: An application that is able to observe state and suggest an action. It also receives feedback to let it know whether the action was good, or not.\n","2. An environment: This is the place where the agent acts within. It accepts an action, which alterts its internal state, and produces a new observation of that state.\n","In nearly all of the examples that I have seen, these two entities are implemented independently. The agent is often an RL algorithm (although not always) and the environment is either real life or a simulation.\n","\n","### The MDP Interface\n","The agent and the environment interact through an interface. You have some control over what goes into that interface and a large amount of effort is typically spent improving the quality of the data that flows through it. You need representations of:\n","1. State: This is the observation of the environment. You often get to choose what to “show” to the agent. There is a compromise between simplifying the state to speed up learning and preventing overfitting, but often it pays to include as much as you can.\n","2. Action: Your agent must suggest an action. This mutates the environment in some way. So called “options” or “null-actions” allow you to do nothing, if that’s what you want to do.\n","3. Reward: You use the reward to fine-tune your action choices."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GICm97ENDDaS"},"source":["### Creating a “GridWorld” Environment\n","To make it easy to understand, I’m going to show you how to create a simulation of a simple grid-based “world”.

The so-called-world is actually a series of cells inside a 2-dimensional box. The agent can move north, east, south, or west which moves the robot between the cells. The goal of the environment is to reach a goal. There is a reward of -1 for every step, to promote reaching the goal as fast as possible.\n","\n","### Imports and Definitions\n","First let me import a few libraries (to enable the autocompletion in later cells) and define a few important definitions. The first is the defacto definition of a “point” object, with x and y coordinates and the second is a direction enumeration.

However, once it has then it replicates the same movements again to reach the goal. This is not stricly learning, it is memoising, so it is not an RL algorithm. However, you shouldn’t discount it, because it is a very good and simple baseline. It can easily complete very sophisticated tasks if you give it enough time.\n","\n","Instead, let me introduce a slight variation to this algorithm called the Monte Carlo (MC) method. This lies at the heart of all modern RL algorithms so it is a great way to start.\n","\n","In short – you can read more about this in Chapter 2 of the book – MC methods attempt to randomly sample states and judge their value.

In general, the idea is that if you can sample the environment enough times, you can begin to build a picture of the output, given any input. We can use this idea in RL.
