While these gradient-based meta-learning models achieve promising performances to some extent, a fundamental problem of them is how to adapt the global knowledge learned from previous tasks for the recommendations of cold-start users more effectively.\n","\n","TaNP directly maps the observed interactions of each user to a predictive distribution, sidestepping some training issues in gradient-based meta-learning models. More importantly, to balance the trade-off between model capacity and adaptation reliability, TaNP uses a novel task-adaptive mechanism. It enables this model to learn the relevance of different tasks and customize the global knowledge to the task-related decoder parameters for estimating user preferences."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cRWoUWlraKKb"},"source":["Inspired by the significant improvements of meta learning, the pioneering work of [Vartak et. al.](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46346.pdf) provides a meta-learning strategy to solve cold-start problems. It uses a task-dependent way to generate the varying biases of decision layers for different tasks, but it is prone to underfitting and is not flexible enough to handle various recommendation scenarios. [MeLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00413) adopts the framework of MAML. Specifically, it divides the model parameters into two groups, i.e., the personalized parameter and the embedding parameter. The personalized parameter is characterized as a fully-connected DNN to estimate user preferences. The embedding parameter is referred as the embeddings of users and items learned from side-information. An inner-outer loop is used to update these two groups of parameters. In the inner loop, the personalized parameter is locally updated via the prediction loss of support set in current task. In the outer loop, these parameters are globally updated according to the prediction loss of query sets in multiple tasks. Through the fashion of local-global update, MeLU can provide a shared initialization for different tasks. The later work [MetaCS](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Meta-Learning-for-User-Cold-Start-Recommendation-Bharadhwaj/f3135b553f592dc42d4202c90739c99486103fc3) is much similar to MeLU, and the main difference is that the local-global update involves all parameters from input embedding to model prediction. To generalize well for different tasks, [MetaHIN](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/accepted-papers/view/meta-learning-on-heterogeneous-information-networks-for-cold-start-recommen) and [MAMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03183) propose different task-specific adaptation strategies. In particular, MetaHIN incorporates heterogeneous information networks (HINs) into MAML to capture rich semantics of meta-paths. MAMO introduces two memory matrices based on user profiles: a feature-specific memory that provides a specific bias term for the shared parameter initialization; a task-specific memory that guides the model for predictions. However, these two gradient-based meta-learning models may still suffer from potential training issues in MAML, and the model-level innovations of them are closely related with side-information, which limits their application scenarios."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2LroOGYgZ9Zg"},"source":["## Background\n","\n","### Meta Learning in Recommenders\n","\n","Inspired by the huge progress on few-shot learning and meta learning, there emerge some promising works on solving cold-start problems from the perspective of meta learning, where making recommendations for one user is regarded as a single task.\n","\n","In the training phase, they try to derive the global knowledge across different tasks as a strong generalization prior. When a cold-start user comes in the test phase, the personalized recommendation for her/him can be predicted with only a few interacted items are available, but does so by using the global knowledge already learned.\n","\n","Most meta-learning recommenders are built upon the well-known framework of model-agnostic meta learning (MAML), aiming to learn a parameter initialization where a few steps of gradient updates will lead to good performances on the new tasks. A typical assumption here is the recommendations of different users are highly relevant. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in actual scenarios. When the users exhibit different purchase intentions, the task relevance among them is actually very weak, which makes it problematic to find a shared parameter initialization optimal for all users.
