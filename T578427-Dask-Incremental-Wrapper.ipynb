Scikit-Learn provides the partial_fit API to stream batches of data to an estimator that can be fit in batches.\n","\n","Normally, if you pass a Dask Array to an estimator expecting a NumPy array, the Dask Array will be converted to a single, large NumPy array. On a single machine, you’ll likely run out of RAM and crash the program. On a distributed cluster, all the workers will send their data to a single machine and crash it.\n","\n","`dask_ml.wrappers.Incremental` provides a bridge between Dask and Scikit-Learn estimators supporting the partial_fit API. You wrap the underlying estimator in Incremental. Dask-ML will sequentially pass each block of a Dask Array to the underlying estimator’s partial_fit method.\n","\n","`dask_ml.wrappers.Incremental` is a meta-estimator (an estimator that takes another estimator) that bridges scikit-learn estimators expecting NumPy arrays, and users with large Dask Arrays.\n","\n","Each block of a Dask Array is fed to the underlying estimator’s partial_fit method. The training is entirely sequential, so you won’t notice massive training time speedups from parallelism. In a distributed environment, you should notice some speedup from avoiding extra IO, and the fact that models are typically much smaller than data, and so faster to move between machines."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ey0Jpw-8lZwT"},"source":["!pip install -q -U dask-ml distributed"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pTNPnXdgE4sP","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":197},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635251750153,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1938,"user":{"displayName":"Sparsh Agarwal","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"13037694610922482904"}},"outputId":"e06f0da2-ea5c-4bee-eeef-ea242a7b7828"},"source":["from dask_ml.datasets import make_classification\n","from dask_ml.wrappers import Incremental\n","from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\n","\n","X, y = make_classification(chunks=25)\n","X"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<table>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>\n","            <table>\n","                <thead>\n","                    <tr>\n","                        <td> </td>\n","                        <th> Array </th>\n","                        <th> Chunk </th>\n","                    </tr>\n","                </thead>\n","                <tbody>\n","                    \n","                    <tr>\n","                        <th> Bytes </th>\n","                        <td> 15.62 kiB </td>\n","                        <td> 3.91 kiB </td>\n","                    </tr>\n","                    \n","                    <tr>\n","                        <th> Shape </th>\n","                        <td> (100, 20) </td>\n","                        <td> (25, 20) </td>\n","                    </tr>\n","                    <tr>\n","                        <th> Count </th>\n","                        <td> 4 Tasks </td>\n","                        <td> 4 Chunks </td>\n","                    </tr>\n","                    <tr>\n","                    <th> Type </th>\n","                    <td> float64 </td>\n","                    <td> numpy.ndarray </td>\n","                    </tr>\n","                </tbody>\n","            </table>\n","        </td>\n","        <td>\n","        <svg width=\"92\" height=\"170\" style=\"stroke:rgb(0,0,0);stroke-width:1\" >\n","\n","  <!-- Horizontal lines -->\n","  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"42\" y2=\"0\" style=\"stroke-width:2\" />\n","  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"30\" x2=\"42\" y2=\"30\" />\n","  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"60\" x2=\"42\" y2=\"60\" />\n","  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"90\" x2=\"42\" y2=\"90\" />\n","  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"120\" x2=\"42\" y2=\"120\" style=\"stroke-width:2\" />\n","\n","  <!-- Vertical lines -->\n","  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"120\" style=\"stroke-width:2\" />\n","  <line x1=\"42\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"42\" y2=\"120\" style=\"stroke-width:2\" />\n","\n","  <!-- Colored Rectangle -->\n","  <polygon points=\"0.0,0.0 42.00989029700999,0.0 42.00989029700999,120.0 0.0,120.0\" style=\"fill:#ECB172A0;stroke-width:0\"/>\n","\n","  <!-- Text -->\n","  <text x=\"21.004945\" y=\"140.000000\" font-size=\"1.0rem\" font-weight=\"100\" text-anchor=\"middle\" >20</text>\n","  <text x=\"62.009890\" y=\"60.000000\" font-size=\"1.0rem\" font-weight=\"100\" text-anchor=\"middle\" transform=\"rotate(-90,62.009890,60.000000)\">100</text>\n","</svg>\n","        </td>\n","    </tr>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["dask.array<normal, shape=(100, 20), dtype=float64, chunksize=(25, 20), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":1}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Lzfx3kg9lWRf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635251781117,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":689,"user":{"displayName":"Sparsh Agarwal","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"13037694610922482904"}},"outputId":"0c2f36d5-4622-4ea8-e22d-bcb95238dc2a"},"source":["estimator = SGDClassifier(random_state=10, max_iter=100)\n","\n","clf = Incremental(estimator)\n","\n","clf.fit(X, y, classes=[0, 1])"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Incremental(estimator=SGDClassifier(max_iter=100, random_state=10))"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rwDTTeelmfiR"},"source":["In this example, we make a (small) random Dask Array.
