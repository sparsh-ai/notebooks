Lets take a look at a summary of the class before looking at the code:\n","- **Constructor (init)**: receive all recommendation algorithms, besides the actual rating list and the list of items. All data is contained in the data downloaded from Coursera. Besides storing all recommendation algorithms, the constructor also calculate the 20 most frequent items, which is used in the popularity metric calculation.\n","\n","- **get_observed_ratings**: as the ratings matrix is sparse, this method only returns the items a user with id userId has purchased.\n","\n","- **get_top_n**: by ordering all the predicted ratings for each recommendation algorithm, we can extract what would be their 'top' recommendation for a given user. Given a parameter $n$, we can then return all the top $n$ recommendations for all the recommendation algorithms.\n","\n","- **rmse**: by comparing the observed ratings a given user has given to an item and the predicted rating an algorithm has defined for a user, we can have an idea of how much error the algorithm is predicting the user's ratings. Here we don't work with lists, as usually each user has rated only a few amount of items. So here we get all the items the user has rated, recover these items from the algorithms' recommendations and them calculate the error.\n","\n","- **nDCG**: By looking at lists now, we can have an idea of how optimal the ranked lists are. By using the scoring factor defined in the report, we can calculate the overall DCG for the recommenders' lists and then normalise them using the concepts of the nDCG.\n","\n","- **Price and avalaibility diversity**: Diversity metric which evaluate how the recommended items' prices vary, *i.e.*, how is the standard deviation of the price. The higher, the better in this case. The same is for the availability index, but here, with higher standard deviations, it means the models are recommending items which are present and not present in local stores.\n","\n","- **Popularity**: A popular recommender tries to recommend items which has a high chance of being purchased. In the formulation of this metric, an item has a high chance of being purchased if lots of people have purchased them. In the class constructor, we take the observed ratings data and the item list and select which were the top $n$ (standard = 20) most purchased data. In a recommendation list, we return the ration of how many items were inside this list of top $n$ ones."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"ETZ5bS6asEmK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1628257817294,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":592,"user":{"displayName":"Sparsh Agarwal","photoUrl":"","userId":"13037694610922482904"}}},"source":["class RecommenderEvaluator:\n","    \n","    def __init__(self, items, actual_ratings, content_based, user_user, item_item, matrix_fact, pers_bias):\n","        \n","        self.items = items\n","        self.actual_ratings = actual_ratings\n","        # static data containing the average score given by each user\n","        self.average_rating_per_userid = actual_ratings.apply(lambda row: np.average(row[~np.isnan(row)]))\n","        \n","        self.content_based = content_based\n","        self.user_user = user_user\n","        self.item_item = item_item\n","        self.matrix_fact = matrix_fact\n","        self.pers_bias = pers_bias\n","        \n","        # aggregate list.

So, if the popularity is focused in the future, we can either change the popularity concept or improve mechanics in the recommender so it predict higher scores for the most popular items in the store.\n","\n","After this evaluation, it seemed to us that the item-item recommender system had an overall better performance, highlighted in terms of its diversity scores. Unfortunately, the items that item item recommender has suggested are in overall pricy, and we can check if there is any mixture possibility with the pers_bias algorithm, as it really indicated cheap prices and a low price standard deviation.
