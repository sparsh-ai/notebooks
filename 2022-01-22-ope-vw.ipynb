For example, say you have a (biased) DM estimator.

Generally, our toy example has far too little data with which to perform reliable estimates, but the principle applied: lower is better, so your candidate policy is estimated to perform better than the production policy in production. The exact definition of OPE is important: in this case, it means that had you deployed the candidate policy, with no exploration, instead of the production policy you could have expected to see the average cost reduce from 0.625 to 0.250000 for the period of time covered in the test set.\n","\n","Feel free to gridsearch several candidate policies using the same setup, to determine a combination of hyperparameters that work well for your use case.

From the point of view of OPE, the objective is the same: determining if a candidate policy is better than the one currently in production. But the setup differs slightly: since any policy deployed will continue to learn online, the key question is how well it will generalise to new examples coming in, considering that the policy is constantly evolving. So in this case, our candidate policy is in fact not a fixed policy, but one that changes constantly. It may help to think of it as a set of hyperparameters instead. The aim is to find out which set of these hyperparameters learns best in an online fashion.\n","\n","To answer this question, we leverage progressive validation (PV), a validation process implemented in VW. PV is explained in detail elsewhere (see e.g. John Langford’s talk on real world interactive learning), but for this tutorial, it is enough to know that for one-pass learning, the loss reported by progressive validation deviates like a test set yet allows you to train on all of your data.
