BDD focuses on clarifying communications; you iterate over the requirements with the end user, defining the behaviors they want.\n","\n","Before you write a single lick of code, you make sure that you have agreement on what the right thing to build is. The set of defined behaviors will drive what code you write. You work with the end user (or their proxy, such as a business analyst or product manager) to define your requirements as a specification. These specifications follow a formal language, to introduce a bit more rigidity in their definition.
