All you have to do is predict the expected return from being in each new state. For example, say you wanted to get into reinforcement learning. You could go back to university, read the books, or go and watch TV. Each of these have value, but with different costs and lengths of time. The expected return of watching TV is probably very low. The expected return of reading the book is high, but doesn’t guarantee a job. Going back to university still doesn’t guarantee a job, but it might make it easier to get past HR, but it takes years to achieve.
