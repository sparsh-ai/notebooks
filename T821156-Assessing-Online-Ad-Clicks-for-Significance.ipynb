Fred just launched a burger bistro in the city of Brisbane. The bistro is open for business, but business is slow. Fred wants to entice new customers to come and try his tasty burgers. To do this, Fred will run an online advertising campaign directed at Brisbane residents. Every weekday, between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., Fred will purchase 3,000 ads aimed at hungry locals. Every ad will be viewed by a single Brisbane resident. The text of every ad will read, “Hungry? Try the Best Burger in Brisbane. Come to Fred’s.” Clicking the text will take potential customers to Fred’s site. Each displayed ad will cost our friend one cent, but Fred believes the investment will be worth it.\n","\n","Fred is getting ready to execute his ad campaign. However, he runs into a problem. Fred previews his ad, and its text is blue. Fred believes that blue is a boring color. He feels that other colors could yield more clicks. Fortunately, Fred’s advertising software allows him to choose from 30 different colors. Is there a text color that will bring more clicks than blue? Fred decides to find out.\n","\n","Fred instigates an experiment. Every weekday for a month, Fred purchases 3,000 online ads. The text of every ad is assigned to one of 30 possible colors. The advertisements are distributed evenly by color. Thus, 100 ads with the same color are viewed by 100 people every day. For example, 100 people view a blue ad, and another 100 people view a green ad. These numbers add up to 3,000 views that are distributed across the 30 colors. Fred’s advertising software automatically tracks all daily views. It also records the daily clicks associated with each of the 30 colors. The software stores this data in a table. That table holds the clicks per day and views per day for every specified color. Each table row maps a color to the views and clicks for all analyzed days.\n","\n","Fred has carried out his experiment. He obtained ad-click data for all 20 weekdays of the month. That data is organized by color. Now, Fred wants to know if there is a color that draws significantly more ad clicks than blue. Unfortunately, Fred doesn’t know how to properly interpret the results. He’s not sure which clicks are meaningful and which clicks have occurred purely randomly. Fred is brilliant at broiling burgers but has no training in data analysis. This is why Fred has turned to you for help. Fred asks you to analyze his table and to compare the counts of daily clicks. He’s searching for a color that draws significantly more ad clicks than blue. Are you willing to help Fred? If so, he’s promised you free burgers for a year!\n","\n","### Dataset description\n","\n","Fred’s ad-click data is stored in the file colored_ad_click_table.csv. The first 99 characters of that line are *Color,Click Count: Day 1,View Count: Day 1,Click Count: Day 2,View Count: Day 2,Click Count: Day 3,*.\n","\n","Let’s briefly clarify the column labels:\n","\n","- Column 1: *Color*\n","    - Each row in the column corresponds to one of 30 possible text colors.\n","- Column 2: *Click Count: Day 1*\n","    - The column tallies the times each colored ad was clicked on day 1 of Fred’s experiment.\n","- Column 3: *View Count: Day 1*\n","    - The column tallies the times each ad was viewed on day 1 of Fred’s experiment.\n","    - According to Fred, all daily views are expected to equal 100.\n","- The remaining 38 columns contain the clicks per day and views per day for the other 19 days of the experiment.\n","\n","To address the problem at hand, we need to know how to do the following: 1) Measure the centrality and dispersion of sampled data, 2) Interpret the significance of two diverging means through p-value calculation, 3) Minimize mistakes associated with misleading p-value measurements, 4) Load and manipulate data stored in tables using Python.\n","\n","Our aim is to discover an ad color that generates significantly more clicks than blue. We will do so by following these steps:\n","\n","1. Load and clean our advertising data using Pandas.\n","2. Run a permutation test between blue and the other recorded colors.\n","3. Check the computed p-values for statistical significance using a properly determined significance level."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"S3g09yrUCHPx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637305851357,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":577,"user":{"displayName":"Sparsh

Should Fred carry out that substitution? Perhaps. Let’s consider our two alternative scenarios. In the first scenario, the null hypothesis is true. If that’s the case, then both blue and ultramarine share the same population mean. Under these circumstances, swapping ultramarine for blue will not affect the ad click rate. In the second scenario, the higher ultramarine click rate is actually statistically significant. If that’s the case, then swapping ultramarine for blue will yield more ad clicks. Therefore, Fred has everything to gain and nothing to lose by setting all his ads to ultramarine.\n","\n","From a logical standpoint, Fred should definitely swap blue for ultramarine. But if he carries out the swap, some uncertainty will remain; Fred will never know if ultramarine truly returns more clicks than blue. What if Fred’s curiosity gets the best of him? If he really wants an answer, his only choice is to run another experiment. In that experiment, half the displayed ads would be blue and the other displayed ads would be ultramarine. Fred’s software would exhibit the advertisements while recording all the clicks and views. Then we could recompute the p-value and compare it to the appropriate significance level, which would remain at 0.05.
