One of the simplest metrics that can be used is the movie rating. However, this suffers from a variety of disadvantages. In the first place, the movie rating does not take the popularity of a movie into consideration. Therefore, a movie rated 9 by 100,000 users will be placed below a movie rated 9.5 by 100 users.\n","This is not desirable as it is highly likely that a movie watched and rated only by 100 people caters to a very specific niche and may not appeal as much to the average person as the former.\n","\n","It is also a well-known fact that as the number of voters increase, the rating of a movie normalizes and it approaches a value that is reflective of the movie's quality and popularity with the general populace. To put it another way, movies with very few ratings are not very reliable. A movie rated 10/10 by five users doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good movie.\n","\n","Therefore, what we need is a metric that can, to an extent, take into account the movie rating and the number of votes it has garnered (a proxy for popularity). This would give a greater preference to a blockbuster movie rated 8 by 100,000 users over an art house movie rated 9 by 100 users.\n","\n","Fortunately, we do not have to brainstorm a mathematical formula for the metric. As the title of this chapter states, we are building an IMDB top 250 clone. Therefore, we shall use IMDB's weighted rating formula as our metric. Mathematically, it can be represented as
