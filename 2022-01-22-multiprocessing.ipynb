Every time we execute this program, we will get a different value of x that's a lot lower than 2,000,000. This is because of the race condition between the two threads. Let's look at a scenario where threads Th 1 and Th 2 are running the critical section (x+=1) at the same time. Both threads will ask for the current value of x. If we assume the current value of x is 100, both threads will read it as 100 and increment it to a new value of 101. The two threads will write back to the memory the new value of 101. This is a one-time increment and, in reality, the two threads should increment the variable independently of each other and the final value of x should be 102. How can we achieve this? This is where thread synchronization comes to the rescue.\n","\n","Thread synchronization can be achieved by using a Lock class from the threading module. The lock is implemented using a semaphore object provided by the operating system. A semaphore is a synchronization object at the operating system level to control access to the resources and data for multiple processors and threads. The Lock class provides two methods, acquire and release, which are described next:\n","\n","The acquire method is used to acquire a lock. A lock can be blocking (default) or non-blocking. In the case of a blocking lock, the requesting thread's execution is blocked until the lock is released by the current acquiring thread. Once the lock is released by the current acquiring thread (unlocked), then the lock is provided to the requesting thread to proceed. In the case of a non-blocking acquire request, the thread execution is not blocked. If the lock is available (unlocked), then the lock is provided (and locked) to the requesting thread to proceed, otherwise the requesting thread gets False as a response.\n","\n","The release method is used to release a lock, which means it resets the lock to an unlocked state. If there is any thread blocking and waiting for the lock, it will allow one of the threads to proceed.\n","\n","The above code example is revised with the use of a lock around the increment statement on the shared variable x. In this revised example, we created a lock at the main thread level and then passed it to the inc function to acquire and release a lock around the shared variable.
