Pipelines are very common in machine learning and deep learning systems because these systems are data-rich. That is, they demand large volumes of data to perform. Input pipelines are the best way to transform large datasets because they break down processing into manageable components.\n","\n","Each component of an input pipeline pulls in a large amount of data, processes it in some manner, and spits out the result. The next component pulls in the resultant data, processes it in another manner, and spits out its own output.
