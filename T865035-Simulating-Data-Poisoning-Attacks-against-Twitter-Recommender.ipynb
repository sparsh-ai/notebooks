All experiments documented here follow the procedure outlined below:\n","\n","1. Load a dataset of anonymized retweet interactions collected from actual Twitter data.\n","2. Train a collaborative filtering model on the loaded data.\n","3. Select a target account to be \"amplified\" such that it is recommended to a set of users who have interacted with a separate, high-profile user also in the dataset. We select 20 such users as a \"control\" set.\n","4. Implement recommendation logic based on cosine similarity of the vector representations of the trained model, and observe recommendations for the control set.\n","5. Select a set of \"amplifier accounts\" that have not interacted with either the target account or the high-profile account, and are not members of the control set.\n","6. For a number of different proposed sets of amplifier accounts and parameter choices, create a new dataset containing additional interactions between each selected amplifier account and both the target account and the high-profile account. In practise, this process involves appending two new rows per amplifier account - one adding a retweet count for the target account and another adding retweet count for the high-profile account.\n","7. Train a new model on the modified dataset.\n","8. Run both target-based and source-based recommendations for each member of the control group and record the number of times the target appeared in the top-n (3) recommendations.\n","9. Present and discuss the results."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wNTGLPWfSpsv"},"source":["!pip install -U
