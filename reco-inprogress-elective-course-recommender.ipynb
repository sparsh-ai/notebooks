The primary learning objective of the course will be – i) to gain knowledge about the basic concepts and techniques of IR.; ii) understand the basic functionality and underlying algorithm of an IR system.; iii) understand modern neural networks and deep learning-based techniques that are used in today’s’ IR systems.; and iv) to learn about several applications of e.g., question answering, image, and video retrieval; v) learn how to develop a basic IR system from scratch and evaluate the system; vi) learn classification, clustering, topic modeling which are the core modules in an IR system.\n","\n","\n","pre-requsities: Prior knowledge of elementary linear algebra would be helpful but is not required for this course.\n","Programming knowledge preferably in Python.\n","Object-orientated programming.\n","Data structure.\n","\n","\n","learning objectives:Gain knowledge about the basic concepts and techniques of IR.\n","Understand the basic functionality and underlying algorithms of an IR system.\n","Understand modern neural networks and deep learning-based techniques that are used in today’s IR systems.\n","Learn about several applications of e.g., question answering, image, and video retrieval.\n","Learn how to develop a basic IR system from scratch and evaluate the system.\n","Learn clarification, clustering, topic modeling which are the core modules in an IR system.\n","\n","\n","measuerable outcomes:Identifying important concepts of Information Retrieval.\n","Learn vector space modeling, modern deep learning techniques for IR and evaluation methods.
